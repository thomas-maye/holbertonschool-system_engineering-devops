## Web Infrastructure Design for `www.foobar.com`

### Components

1. **Web Server (Nginx)**: Serves static content and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
2. **Application Server**: Hosts the application logic and processes dynamic content.
3. **Load Balancer (HAProxy)**: Distributes traffic between application servers to ensure high availability and scalability.  
   - **Algorithm**: **Round-robin** is used to distribute traffic evenly across servers.
   - **Setup**: **Active-Active** allows all servers to handle traffic concurrently, maximizing resource utilization.
4. **Set of Application Files**: Ensures consistency across servers by storing the codebase on shared volumes.
5. **Database (MySQL)**: A primary-replica setup is used, with one primary node for writes and replicas for reads.

### Database: Primary-Replica Cluster

- **Primary Node**: Handles writes (inserts/updates).
- **Replica Node**: Handles reads and provides redundancy.

### Infrastructure Issues

- **SPOF (Single Points of Failure)**: 
  - **Load Balancer**: If it fails, traffic is disrupted. Solution: Use redundant load balancers.
  - **Primary Database Node**: If it fails, writes are blocked. Solution: Implement automatic failover for high availability.

- **Security Issues**:
  - **No Firewall**: Exposes the system to attacks. Solution: Add a firewall to restrict access.
  - **No HTTPS**: Data is transmitted in plaintext. Solution: Use SSL/TLS for secure communication.

- **No Monitoring**: Without monitoring tools, itâ€™s hard to track performance. Solution: Implement monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).

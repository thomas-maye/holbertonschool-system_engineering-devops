# 2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure

![2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure](https://github.com/thomas-maye/holbertonschool-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/web_infrastructure_design/images/2.%20Secured%20and%20monitored%20web%20infrastructure.jpeg)

## Web Infrastructure Design for `www.foobar.com`

## Components

- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic and terminates SSL, offloading encryption from the web servers.
- **Web Server**: Handles requests, application logic, and serves content.
- **Database Server**: Stores persistent data. A single writable node with read replicas for redundancy.
- **Firewalls**:
  - **Firewall 1**: Protects traffic between the client and load balancer.
  - **Firewall 2**: Protects traffic between the load balancer and web servers.
  - **Firewall 3**: Protects traffic between the web servers and the database.
- **SSL Certificate**: Ensures HTTPS encryption for secure communication.
- **Monitoring Clients**: Collects performance data from each server and sends it to a monitoring service (e.g., Sumologic).

## Why Each Element Is Added

- **Firewalls**: Protect servers from unauthorized access and potential attacks.
- **SSL Certificate**: Encrypts traffic to ensure secure data transmission and prevent interception.
- **Monitoring Clients**: Tracks server health, performance, and errors, providing insights into potential issues.
- **HTTPS Traffic**: Secures the communication between users and servers, preventing data leaks.

## Monitoring and Data Collection

- **Monitoring Tool**: Collects metrics like CPU usage, error rates, and QPS (queries per second) through clients installed on each server.
- **QPS Monitoring**: The database and web servers track and report query statistics, which are sent to the monitoring tool for analysis.

## Potential Issues

- **SSL Termination at the Load Balancer**: It could expose data if internal traffic isnâ€™t encrypted. Use HTTPS between the load balancer and web servers.
- **Single MySQL Server for Writes**: A single writable database server can be a bottleneck and failure point. Use replication and failover mechanisms for availability.
- **Same Components on All Servers**: Having all components on one server can cause resource conflicts. Separate roles to improve performance and scalability.

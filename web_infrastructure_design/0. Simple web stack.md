## 1. What is a server?

A server is a powerful computer or a virtualized instance designed to store, process, and manage data, applications, or services over a network. In this infrastructure, the server with IP `8.8.8.8` hosts all the components required for the website `www.foobar.com`, such as the web server, application server, and database.

## 2. What is the role of the domain name?

The domain name (`foobar.com`) acts as a human-readable address that points to the server's IP address. Instead of requiring users to remember the server's IP (`8.8.8.8`), they can simply type `www.foobar.com` into their browser. The DNS (Domain Name System) resolves the domain name to the IP address.

## 3. What type of DNS record is www in `www.foobar.com`?

The `www` in `www.foobar.com` is represented as an **A record** in the DNS configuration. This A record maps the domain name (`www.foobar.com`) to the server's IP address (`8.8.8.8`).

## 4. What is the role of the web server?

The web server (e.g., **Nginx**) serves as the intermediary between the user and the backend components. Its roles include:

- Handling incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests.
- Serving static files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Forwarding dynamic requests (e.g., API calls) to the application server.

## 5. What is the role of the application server?

The application server executes the logic of the website. It processes requests from the web server that require dynamic content, interacts with the database, and returns a response (usually in JSON format) to the web server.

## 6. What is the role of the database?

The database (e.g., **MySQL**) stores and retrieves structured data needed by the application. For example:

- User accounts and passwords.
- Content for the website.
- Logs of user activities.

The application server queries the database to retrieve or update information and sends the results back to the user through the web server.

## 7. What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website?

The server communicates with the user's computer over the internet using the **HTTP** or **HTTPS** protocol. The browser sends HTTP/HTTPS requests to the server (IP `8.8.8.8`), and the server responds with the requested resources or data.

## 8. What are the issues with this infrastructure?

This single-server infrastructure has several limitations:

- **SPOF (Single Point of Failure):**  
  If the server fails (hardware failure, network issue, etc.), the entire website becomes unavailable. There is no redundancy.
- **Downtime during maintenance:**  
  When maintenance is required, such as deploying new code, restarting the web server, or updating the application/database, the server must be taken offline, causing downtime for users.
- **Scalability:**  
  The single server cannot handle increased traffic efficiently. If the number of users accessing the website grows significantly, the server might become overloaded, leading to slow performance or crashes.

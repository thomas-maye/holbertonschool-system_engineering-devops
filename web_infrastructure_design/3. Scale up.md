# 3. Scale up

## Components

1. **Load Balancers (HAProxy Cluster)**  
   Two HAProxy instances are configured as a cluster for redundancy, ensuring continuous availability even if one fails.  
   **Why added**: Prevents single points of failure (SPOF) at the traffic distribution level and ensures high availability.

2. **Web Server**  
   Dedicated server running Nginx to handle static files and act as a reverse proxy for dynamic requests.  
   **Why added**: Improves performance and separates static content management from application logic.

3. **Application Server**  
   Dedicated server hosting the backend application code, processing business logic and interacting with the database.  
   **Why added**: Ensures scalability and isolates application processing from web and database services.

4. **Database Server (MySQL)**  
   A dedicated database server managing persistent data.  
   **Why added**: Ensures proper handling of data storage and queries, isolating the database workload for better performance and security.

## Advantages of Splitting Components

- **Improved Performance**: Each server focuses on a specific role, reducing resource contention.
- **Scalability**: Each component can scale independently to handle increased traffic or data load.
- **Fault Isolation**: Issues in one layer do not directly impact others, improving overall reliability.
